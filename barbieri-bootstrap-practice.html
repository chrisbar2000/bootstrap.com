    <p>Similar to that of Autoimmune Encephalitis, this is an autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks
      your brain. More in depth, the immune system
      misinterprets your brain cells or tissues for anti-bacteria. This leads to brain inflammation. Doctors or medical
      professionals can not explain why
      this happens. It is usually uncommon or rare. </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p>This disease was first discovered by Dr. Susan Swedo in 1998. Technically back in 1995 was the first
        real case of P.A.N.D.A.S where doctors found that other people underwent serious changes from some disaease
        caused by strep infection. That was when Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with
        Streptoccal was born. The first study. Tweleve years later, The P.A.N.S.
        Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric disease was discovered in 2010. This is another version of the disease.

      <p>This autoimmune disease can often go misdiagnosed by doctors or medical professionals. They don't necessarily
        understand why someone would change like that to that degree. It is very rare and mysterious. However it is
        interesting, the stories that other people and I myself had to go through. When developing this disease, it can
        lead to serious complications which can take up to months to find the answer.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p>This disease can face a lot of challenges. Your life can be altered based on the struggles of this disease. The
        mechanism behind this disease is intense strep throat. It is even similar to that of Sydenham's Chorea. </p>

          Compulsive Disorder. More symptoms can be strange obsession over parents or family. It can also range to not
          eating or having strict eating restrictions. The disease can even be linked to reducing the amount of food you
          consume in your body. You can experience decline in school. It's called academic deterioration. You can lose
          previously gained skills or abilities. You can have constant irribility, and unneccesary aggression. You can

          More symptoms can actually be more serious. Leading to behavioral and pschological symptoms after the nasty
          strep infection. Symptoms similar to that of Tics or Tourette Syndrome are also involved. Symptoms similar to
          that of ADHD can occur. You can experience severe oppositional behaviors. It's called O.D.D., which stands for
          Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Your handwriting can be strangely huge. Your personality can change.
